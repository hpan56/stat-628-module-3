    "Keeping fit is becoming increasingly popular, so as its related business -- Gymnasium. As a popular website to recommend business, Yelp and its rating about a business influence consumers' choice. In order to give some recommendations for gyms' owners to improve, we use Yelp datasets that contains reviews text and other attributes of the each gym to generate recommendations. After data cleaning, we constructed a random forest model to select aspects which mostly effect the stars of a gym. Then, we assign the weight of these aspects according to attributes of users and reviewing time. Finally, we give suggestions to gyms' owners in two aspects: First, overall suggestion to all gyms according to the whole dataset analysis. Second, the specific suggestion to a specific gym (and its owner) according to its reviews. The final suggestion would be given in our Shiny APP."

For example, the attribute: **\"By Appointment Only\"** and **\"Good for Kids\"** influence the ratings of a gym. If a gym's \"By Appointment Only\" is True(Positive), then their ratings is likely to be higher than those with False(negative). On the contrary, if a gym's \"Good for Kids\" is True, their ratings are likely to be lower. And their correlation coefficient between rating (1-5) and attribute positive proportion ( True/(True+False) ) is apparent. For \"By Appointment Only\", its positive value proportion is [0.086, 0.106, 0.111, 0.135, 0.243] for rating 1-5, so the correlation coefficient is 0.872. For \"Good for Kids\", positive value proportion is [0.698, 0.678, 0.672, 0.664, 0.637], the correlation value is -0.879. We make some reasonable guess for these results. The reason why appointment only helps improving ratings is that, customers will be satisfied if gyms provide appointment service such as trainers or some classes. While people are doing exercise, kids sometimes trouble them, then permission for kids might cause some trouble to other customers and they complain about it.\n",
