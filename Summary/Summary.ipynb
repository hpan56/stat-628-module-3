    "The goal of the “executive” summary of your data analysis is to provide a concise, replicable, and clear description of your statistical analysis and findings. In particular, the summary must include (i) your overall findings, (ii) relevant and important evidence for your findings (e.g. plots, tables), and (iii) important details of your statistical analysis (e.g. type of model used, inferential quantities, outliers, leverage points, modeling assumptions, etc.). Your summary should be detailed enough that any data scientist can read your summary and replicate your analysis. Your summary must include all relevant figures/tables, equations, and references and must be done using the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    "All members of the group must contribute to the executive summary. On the summary, the group must clearly indicate each member’s contribution to the project, including each member’s contribution to the presentation, code, and the image files. The final summary should not exceed more than 6 pdf pages."
